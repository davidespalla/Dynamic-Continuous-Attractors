# Dynamic-Continuous-Attractors

![alt text](imgs/epigrafe.png?raw=true)

This folder contains code for the numerical simulation and analytical solution of continuous attractor neural network with a dynamic shift mechanism.

In the Numerical-Simulations folder there is the code for the run of a single network dynamics, with various kernel shapes,parameter values and mainfold dimensions, as well as the code for the numerical estimation of the storage capacity, for 1D and 2D dynamic continuous attractors with exponential kernel.

In the Mean-Filed folder there is the code for the numerical solution of the equations dervied analytically in the mean field approximation: the equations for the activity profile in the case of a single map, multiple maps, and the analytical calculation for the storage capacity of an asymmetric, highly diluted network.
